# Basketball Scoreboard

I've just started to learn JavaScript and this is my first solo project from [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/allcourses).

I've implemented a reset button and I tried to modify the background of the winner team.

Find the project on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/YC48MCx4frBFtYoz6rNJE6/Basketball-Scoreboard?node-id=0%3A1&t=TNjCteyXJjQ7CRnw-0)
